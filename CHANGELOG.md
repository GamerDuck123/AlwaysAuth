# v0.4.4 - Yet Another Fix for Velocity

So sorry that this update took so long, I was celebrating Thanksgiving with family and was unable to work on the project!

This update fixes the issue of the plugin disabling itself on Velocity, 
while copying events around I accidentally copied the disable method into the 
player join method so whenever a player joined the plugin got disabled. So it has been fixed!
